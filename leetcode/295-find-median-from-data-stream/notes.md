# 295. Find Median from Data Stream

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-median-from-data-stream/

Median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value. So the median is the mean of the two middle value.

For example:
- `[2,3,4]`, the median is `3`
- `[2,3]`, the median is `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`

Design a data structure that supports the following two operations:
- `void addNum(int num)` - Add a integer number from the data stream to the data structure.
- `double findMedian()` - Return the median of all elements so far.

Example:
```
addNum(1)
addNum(2)
findMedian() -> 1.5
addNum(3)
findMedian() -> 2
```

## Solution

Using binary search, we can find the index where to insert the given number â€“ and this is done in `O(log N)` time.

The `findMedian()` operation can then be done in constant time as we store the whole array. (So `O(n)` space complexity.)

### Follow Ups

From the problem:
- If all integer numbers from the stream are between 0 and 100, how would you optimize it?
- If 99% of all integer numbers from the stream are between 0 and 100, how would you optimize it?

Another thing to consider:
- What if `addNum` will be called so many times that the resulting array could break the memory stack? How can we keep a good time complexity, but lower space complexity?
