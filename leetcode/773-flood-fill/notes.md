# 733. Flood Fill

An image is represented by a 2-D array of integers, each integer representing the pixel value of the image (from 0 to 65535).

Given a coordinate (sr, sc) representing the starting pixel (row and column) of the flood fill, and a pixel value newColor, "flood fill" the image.

To perform a "flood fill", consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to the starting pixel of the same color as the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels (also with the same color as the starting pixel), and so on. Replace the color of all of the aforementioned pixels with the newColor.

At the end, return the modified image.

Example 1:
```
Input:
image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]]
sr = 1, sc = 1, newColor = 2
Output: [[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]
Explanation:
From the center of the image (with position (sr, sc) = (1, 1)), all pixels connected
by a path of the same color as the starting pixel are colored with the new color.
Note the bottom corner is not colored 2, because it is not 4-directionally connected
to the starting pixel.
```

Note:
- The length of `image` and `image[0]` will be in the range `[1, 50]`.
- The given starting pixel will satisfy `0 <= sr < image.length` and `0 <= sc < image[0].length`.
- The value of each color in `image[i][j]` and newColor will be an integer in `[0, 65535]`.

## Solution

This was a type of problem that fairly easy to solve if youâ€™ve done some breadth or depth search problems before.

I have to admit I spent more time figuring out an edge case that I missed (the target pixel can be the same as the new color) than writing the actual BFS algorithm.

### Time and Space Complexity

The time complexity of BFS grows with the matrix size, so `O(n * m)`. Our space complexity is constant, `O(1)`, because we mutate the provided matrix.
